## üöÄ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.astro
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## Steps to Integrate SST and deploy to AWS S3 with Cloudfront

SST is a framework that makes it easy to build modern full-stack applications on your own infrastructure.

Pre-Requisites:
---------------
- Node installed
- Astro project created
- AWS credentials configured

Steps:
------
1. Once Astro project is created, cd into current project
2.  Now initialize SST in your application
        
        npx sst@latest init
3. Once SST is initialized, it will create new file sst.config.ts, sst-env.d.ts, modify tsconfig.json, add sst to package.json.
4. The sst.config.ts file is the main configuration file for SST, which is a framework for deploying serverless applications on AWS. It defines infrastructure and deployment settings.
5. It will also ask to update astro.config.mjs. This file is the configuration file for Astro, a static site generator. It defines how Astro behaves, including build options, integrations, base URLs, and more.
                
                
                import aws from "astro-sst"; //This is an SST adapter that allows deploying Astro to AWS
                export default defineConfig({
                    output: "server", //Enables Server-Side Rendering (SSR) instead of Static Site Generation (SSG).
                    adapter: aws() //Uses the SST AWS adapter (astro-sst) to deploy the site to AWS.
                }); 
                
6. After making these changes, we are good to go.
7. To start in dev mode
        
        npx sst dev // run your AWS application locally while simulating a live AWS environment with hot reloading.
8. To deploy to AWS
        
        npx sst deploy // Fully deploys the app to AWS 
9. Once its deployed successfully, it will generate cloudfront URL where you can access your application.

Notes:
-----
1. sst.aws.Astro is the component specialized for Astro framework to deploy an Astro Site. This automatically integrates with AWS S3 and CloudFront. 
2. If we want to add any other components, we can add them to sst.config.ts file. For ex., If we want to create a bucket to upload some files. We can add it to sst.config.ts as below:
        
        const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("AstroSSTPOCTestBucket"); //This will create a bucket in S3
3. We can link this bucket as part of our Astro app and use it inside the application to upload the files to S3.
    
        new sst.aws.Astro("AstroSSTPOC", {
            link: [bucket]
        });
4. Similarly, we can create any infrastructure as code without the need to create them manually via AWS console or UI.
